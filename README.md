# ImageM
ImageM is a GUI for Image processing with Matlab. 
It has similar GUI with ImageJ, a popular open-source software for image analysis written in java.

The ImageM application is based on the Image class, which gather several image processing algorithms within a unified interface.

## Installation

The application is based on the following dependencies:

* the "Matlab image class" (https://github.com/mattools/matlab-image-class), for the management of images
* the Image Processing Toolbox
* the MatStats library (https://github.com/mattools/matStats), for the management of data tables 
* the Machine Learning and Statistics Toolbox
* the GUI Layout Toolbox V2 (https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox), for the graphical user interface
* some functionalities also require the MatGeom toolbox (https://github.com/mattools/matGeom).

All the required toolbox should be installed and the paths set accordingly. A clone of the project should then suffice to run the ImageM application.
